# Add Application Icons/Images

I'd like to change the application icon. I didn't take the time yet on how this is done for Linux and Windows.

Links with example code:

 - Apply "How do I change taskbar icon", https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions/3971
 - Apply https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/macro.include_image.html
